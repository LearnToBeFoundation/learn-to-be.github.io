Maybe you weren’t sure how to find the best online resources? Or maybe you struggled to keep your student engaged through a computer screen?</p><p id="""">It’s no surprise that virtual tutoring can be challenging. There are often tech-related issues and it can take longer to build a relationship with your student. But the virtual space allows us to connect and learn from others who may be a few miles away or on the other side of the country. While it may take some practice, virtual tutoring has TONs of advantages. Volunteering as a tutor with <a href=""https://www.learntobe.org"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">Learn To Be</strong></a><strong id=""""> </strong>for the last 2 years has taught me a lot about online learning, and I’m excited to share what I’ve discovered!</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Table of Contents:</strong></p><ol id=""""><li id="""">Online Books</li><li id="""">Saving Session Notes</li><li id="""">Enhancing Online Learning Content</li><li id="""">Customizable Games</li><li id="""">Using Tangible Items From Home</li></ol><h2 id="""">1. Online Books</h2><p id="""">Tutoring often involves helping students with their reading. Whether it’s for a book report, a literature class, or simply for learning how to read, books always seem to pop up — and it can be challenging in a fully virtual space.</p><p id="""">Here is how I’ve improved my tutoring using books:</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Online libraries</strong></p><p id="""">Online libraries are among the most underused internet resources. Not only are they free and easily accessible, but they have features that can improve your tutoring experience immensely.</p><p id="""">Here are two I love:</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><a href=""https://libbyapp.com/interview/welcome#doYouHaveACard"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">Libby</strong></a></li><li id=""""><a href=""https://www.overdrive.com/"" target=""_blank"" id=""""><strong id="""">Overdrive</strong></a></li></ol><p id="""">Both Libby and Overdrive are quite similar but there are a few key differences. You sign into both of them with your library card so any books you borrow on Libby will show up on Overdrive and vice versa.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img alt=""library webpage"" src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6591cfa135e450f1bb1af9c9/6591cfa135e450f1bb1afbaf_632a01a9c9f20b0ae80d962c_1*51M0R2uao-rrCK7ZRCCT3Q.png"" id="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""></div><figcaption id="""">Libby</figcaption></figure><p id="""">As for differences, I prefer Libby for in-session tutoring. It has a great interface with tools to annotate and looks great when sharing your screen to read with your student. Although Libby is better for tutoring sessions, Overdrive is better for choosing books and managing your books. It has many more tools for searching, borrowing, and downloading books.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img alt=""screenshot of the OverDrive website homepage"" src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6591cfa135e450f1bb1af9c9/6591cfa135e450f1bb1afbae_632a01a93b3d149ddba4dc65_1*MBHDyQt4u-NuGvuYqh-7qw.png"" id="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""></div><figcaption id="""">OverDrive</figcaption></figure><p id="""">Because all of the books you’ve borrowed on your library card are displayed on <strong id="""">both sites</strong> it is nice to use them simultaneously.</p><p id="""">Through these services, you will have access to thousands of ebooks and audiobooks with your library card. Their website allows you to read books in your browser using tools such as highlighting, font-sizing, bookmarking, and notes. You can share your screen and follow along with your student as they read during your session.</p><h2 id="""">2. ​​Saving Session Notes</h2><p id="""">When I guide my students through an assignment or topic, I often find myself writing formulas, vocabulary words, or step-by-step solutions on the digital whiteboard.</p><p id="""">My students benefited greatly from the things I did in our weekly meetings, but I wanted to make sure these benefits would last beyond our 60–90 minutes each week.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">With this in mind, I sought out a solution.</em></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Here is what I came up with:</strong></p><p id="""">At the end of your session, download your whiteboard and email it to your student. This way, they’ll have those notes for the rest of the week, aiding them with homework, studying, etc.</p><p id="""">Here are the links explaining how you can do this depending on the virtual classroom you are using.</p><ol id=""""><li id=""""><a href=""https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005706806-Using-annotation-tools-for-collaboration"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Zoom</a></li><li id=""""><a href=""https://support.bigbluebutton.org/hc/en-us/articles/1500005215261-Upload-a-Presentation-and-Enable-for-Download-in-BigBlueButton-2-3"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Big Blue Button</a></li></ol><h2 id="""">3. Enhancing online learning content- Reading</h2><p id="""">If you tutor virtually, you are likely familiar with online whiteboards. Both <a href=""https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005706806-Using-annotation-tools-for-collaboration"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Zoom</a> and <a href=""https://support.bigbluebutton.org/hc/en-us/articles/1500005316822-Use-the-multi-user-whiteboard"" target=""_blank"" id="""">BigBlueButton</a> have built-in whiteboards with various drawing tools to make teaching a whole lot easier (and fun too!).</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img alt=""Tutoring screen with diagram for the controls"" src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6591cfa135e450f1bb1af9c9/6591cfa135e450f1bb1afb8e_632a01a9c9f20b232d0d962b_1*UA20cwHu5uvfwTCyIeSDbg.png"" id="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""></div><figcaption id="""">BigBlueButton Whiteboard</figcaption></figure><p id="""">Built-in whiteboards are great for any age, but the particular tips below are good for younger students who need support with reading, so feel free to skip this part if your student is fully capable of reading.</p><p id="""">Your student is likely to encounter a word that they can’t understand right away as they read. When this happens, pull up a blank whiteboard and type out the word they struggle with. Change the color, <strong id="""">bold</strong>, underline or spice it up a bit. Make the word fun! Use the various tools in your drawing toolkit to help your student break down the word. Draw a circle around the “ed” ending, highlight the double “o”, and draw lines between the letters if they need to be pronounced.</p><p id="""">Not only does this reinforce good “sound-it-out” habits, but it also reduces the anxiety of seeing a new word, and creates a more encouraging and positive learning experience.</p><h2 id="""">4. Customizable Games- Math</h2><p id="""">Students need tutors for a variety of different reasons. One common reason is homework assistance. The need for homework help arises when a student is stuck on a problem, needs the lesson retaught, or wants to go over questions they answered incorrectly.</p><p id="""">Personally, tutoring in homework help is a nightmare. It seems easy, but most of the time it is hard not to fall into a pattern of guiding them through each problem while they nod their head in silence. This is not at all effective; you are essentially doing the problem for them! And, even if they seem to understand, their understanding likely won’t stick.</p><p id="""">Here is how I use the virtual classroom to overcome this issue:</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Creating Math Games with the Whiteboard</strong></p><p id=""""><em id="""">Game Suggestion #1: Decimals — “Cash Register”</em></p><p id="""">Either use the whiteboard to draw a “store” or you can find an image online. Share your screen and annotate over it.</p><p id="""">However you choose to do it, I’d suggest leaving a space blank for calculations. My student and I made “receipts” where we’d type up the amount for each item the customer “bought” and add them up.</p><p id="""">My student and I have done this many times! Here is an example of one we did recently.</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image "" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""""><div id=""""><img alt=""Math game on the whiteboard"" src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6591cfa135e450f1bb1af9c9/6591cfa135e450f1bb1afb9f_632a01a9212410782fe69a98_0*FRXOg1lAtVonibpj.png"" id="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" loading=""auto""></div></figure><p id=""""><em id="""">Game Suggestion #2: Fractions — “Pizza Parlor”</em></p><p id="""">Like the previous example, draw some sort of pizza parlor on the whiteboard, or share your screen with a photo of one.</p><p id="""">One person plays the “chef” and one person plays the “customer.” The customer will ask for “a pizza for 8 people, 2/8 of the pizza needs to be cheese, and ¾ of the pizza needs to be pepperoni.”</p><p id="""">The chef will use the annotation tools to then put the correct amount of “cuts” in the pizza and toppings on the right amount of slices.</p><p id="""">This game is super customizable depending on your student’s skill level.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">Game #3: Percents- “Discount Shop”</em></p><p id="""">Just like the previous two examples, create a store or upload a photo of one and share your screen.</p><p id="""">In this game, you will assign prices to each item and then assign a discount of categories of items. (for example: socks are 50% off, t-shirts are 30% off, etc)</p><p id="""">The customer will pick out a few things to purchase and the cashier will have to individually deduct the correct percentage off of each item.</p><h2 id="""">5. Using Items From Home</h2><p id="""">While the first four ideas focus on technology-based solutions for enhancing tutoring, what about non-tech alternatives? The lack of tactile engagement for students is a drawback of online tutoring. There is a need for hands-on activities in nearly every tutoring subject.</p><p id="""">If you’re not seated next to your student, that doesn’t mean you can’t provide them with a tangible learning experience. Here are some examples of when tactile resources can be utilized to enhance tutoring sessions.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Money</strong></p><p id="""">Teaching a student how to add different types of coins and different dollar bills with tangible items is often the difference between a deep understanding and a surface-level understanding. Ask your student to grab a few coins or dollars. You could also use fake coins or dollars (from a game like Monopoly) or cut out paper coins and dollars. You can incorporate this tangible money with the games listed above!</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Books</strong></p><p id="""">Although reading online can be extremely useful, there are also cases in which a physical copy is necessary.</p><p id="""">Encourage them to read from a physical copy instead of the screen if they have one. As I mentioned before, you can always follow along using Libby or Overdrive.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Pen/Paper &amp; Non-virtual Whiteboards</strong></p><p id="""">As an alternative to typing or drawing words on the virtual whiteboard, using google docs, or speaking out loud, have your student write down their spelling words. There is a lot of research that suggests that taking notes helps students retain more information. <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Here</a> is a link to an article explaining this in further detail. Your student can write words on a piece of paper and hold it up to the screen, or if your student has a small physical whiteboard, that’s great to use as well!</p><p id="""">Not only will this improve their confidence in penmanship and letter writing, but it will help them break down words and think more deeply about what they are spelling.</p><p id="""">The use of tactile items can benefit students’ learning in a variety of ways. Go the extra mile by asking your student to retrieve these items and use them during the session. I’d recommend letting the student know ahead of time so they have it ready before the session starts. And keep in mind that you don’t want to make your student go and purchase items if they aren’t in a financial position to do so. So keep it to items around the house!</p><p id="""">Although it may seem like a hassle and you may prefer to stick with your usual technology, in some instances using physical items is the best solution.</p><h2 id="""">To Summarize</h2><p id="""">In many cases, online tutoring can be an advantage, rather than a limitation. You can use the solutions above as a starting point, and I encourage you all to come up with your own creative ways to engage your students virtually.</p><p id="""">If you’re interested in volunteering as a tutor with Learn To Be, like I have for the past 2 years, you can <a href=""https://www.learntobe.org/apply"" target=""_blank"" id="""">learn more and apply here.</a> Or if you know of any students/families in need of free, online, one-on-one tutoring, they are welcome to <a href=""https://www.learntobe.org/student_applications/new"" target=""_blank"" id="""">apply here!</a></p><p id="""">Thank you — I’d love to see your comments or suggestions in the comments below!</p><p id="""">‍</p>"

At that point, tutoring wasn’t really a new experience for me — I had tutored some of my younger sister’s high school friends and some of my peers as an undergraduate as well. However, the interface, the age of the students, and the incredible experience LTB has offered <em id="""">were</em> new.</p><p id="""">I can’t deny, the first time I tutored a student through Learn to Be, I was a little nervous! The age of technology allows for this amazing opportunity — for me, a graduate student in Pennsylvania, to tutor a middle schooler in California. And yet, online tutoring has a unique set of challenges (hence the nerves)! I wasn’t quite sure how the student was going to respond to my own teaching style, I wasn’t sure if they were going to have questions for me or if I was going to have to come up with content for them on the spot, and I was certainly concerned that if they simply decided to get up and walk away from the computer, being 3,000 miles away I was powerless to stop them (a unique challenge with online tutoring).</p><p id=""""><em id="""">Learn To Be has allowed me to see that moment and better yet, help provide that moment, time and time again.</em></p><p id="""">However, my nerves were immediately put to rest the moment I began tutoring. My student, a middle school girl in Los Angeles came to me with her homework assignment for that day and some concepts from class that she was slightly confused about. Together we were able to work through problems on the whiteboard and clear up her confusion, a task that simply took a few examples in addition to the ones she’d seen in class. Seeing her excitement and relief when she was finally able to grasp the concept we were working on and the “oooh now I get it, this is easy!” moment was a rewarding experience to say the least!</p><p id="""">That reaction was not unique to this little girl. Learn To Be has allowed me to see that moment and better yet, help provide that moment, time and time again. Since that first tutoring session, I have tutored every week during the school year. Each week brings a new challenge– the demand to find a way to make confusing concepts understandable– but each week also brings the same smile to my face. The recognition that I am able to use the education I have been lucky enough to receive to help further the knowledge of students who may not necessarily have access to the same resources I do (and did) has been absolutely incredible!</p><p id="""">Written by Megan Barrett.</p><p id="""">‍</p>"

My student became very frustrated at the beginning of our session and started to cry. She did not want to finish some important homework she had to do for school the next day. I tried my best to calm her down and after 45 minutes her sister came into her room and sat next to her. At this point, I was feeling quite emotional because it is upsetting to hear from any young person that they feel so unsure of their reading ability that it drives them to tears. In an attempt to distract her, I asked her sister if she wanted to hear her sister read a story. This immediately brightened her mood and stopped her tears. I watched as she read to her sister perfectly and forgot about making mistakes. My student’s excitement to read for her sister was a very happy moment because I saw her let go of her apprehension and nervousness and prove that she is capable of doing anything she tries.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h2 id=""""> What kind of impact has Learn To Be tutoring had on you?</h2><p id="""">Tutoring with Learn To Be has taught me how easy it is to make an impact in someone’s life. I am always excited to meet my student once or sometimes twice a week. Then, when I join our Zoom meetings, seeing her smile and excitement to see me always brightens my day. This experience has taught me how important it is just to talk with my student and ask her about her day and how she feels. Many kids don’t have this opportunity to build a bond with someone who wants to support their learning and care about how they feel. While my student might not always want to work on reading or grammar, I can tell from her participation and enthusiasm that she enjoys our time together. The past three years of learning online have been extremely difficult for children and this experience has taught me how simple actions can help alleviate this stress. </p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id=""""><em id="""">Interested in earning the PVSA through Learn To Be?

In this blog post, we’ll be sharing some tips and tricks for building confidence in students. Let's begin!<br>‍</p><h4 id="""">Create a Safe Place to Learn</h4><p id="""">A safe place to learn is the first step in building confidence in students. It's important to create an environment where students respect and trust one another. An environment where they feel safe enough to ask questions and share their ideas. Here are a few ways to make a safe learning space:</p><p id="""">‍</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Keep an open line of communication:</strong> Make sure students know that they can come to you with anything. Whether it's instances of bullying or just a papercut, they should feel comfortable enough to approach you.</li></ul><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Set boundaries:</strong> Make clear rules for how to behave and communicate what will happen if those rules aren't followed. While enforcing rules may seem harsh, it’s important to follow through, otherwise you invite chaos into the classroom.</li></ul><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Practice empathy:</strong> Show that you care about your students' problems, both in and out of school. If you notice someone is struggling, ask them about their day, and how they’re doing.</li></ul><h4 id=""""><br>Support Students When They Make Mistakes</h4><p id="""">Mistakes are a natural part of the learning process, and it's important to be supportive when they happen. Instead of focusing on their mistake, discuss how students can learn and grow from the experience. Help them see their mistakes as a learning opportunity rather than a failure. Explain the importance of trusting the process and being persistent.<br>‍</p><h4 id="""">Help Students Set Clear Learning Goals</h4><p id="""">Helping students set clear, actionable learning goals can help them build confidence in their abilities. Help your students identify key areas they need to work on and come up with a strategy to work on them. Check in with them regularly and modify the goals as needed. Celebrate their progress and discuss any challenges that arise.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">‍</p><h4 id="""">Different Ways to Provide Constructive Feedback</h4><p id="""">Providing helpful feedback is important for building confidence in students. Here are some tips for giving feedback that supports growth:</p><p id="""">‍</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Be specific: Clearly say what the student did well and what they can do better.</li></ul><ul id=""""><li id="""">Focus on the task, not the person: Keep feedback about the work, not about the students themselves.</li></ul><ul id=""""><li id="""">Be timely: Give feedback as soon as you can after the work is done so it's more helpful and meaningful.</li></ul><ul id=""""><li id="""">Offer suggestions: Don't just point out problems, give ideas on how the student can improve.</li></ul><h4 id=""""><br>The Power of Encouragement</h4><p id="""">Don't forget how important it is to encourage students. Simple things like a smile, a pat on the back, or a few kind words can really help motivate students to do better. As a virtual tutor, remember to celebrate your students' success, no matter how small, and help them be proud of their progress.<br>‍</p><h4 id="""">Fun Confidence Building Activities for Class</h4><p id="""">Adding confidence building activities to your lessons can be a fun way of building confidence in students. Here are a few activities you can try:</p><p id="""">‍</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">The Compliment Circle: Have students sit in a circle and take turns saying something nice about the person next to them. This activity helps students see their own strengths and those of their classmates.</li></ul><ul id=""""><li id="""">Public Speaking Practice: Let students present on a topic they know a lot about or really like. Giving them a safe place to practice public speaking can help them feel more confident when talking to others.</li></ul><ul id=""""><li id="""">Goal Setting and Reflection: Have students write down a goal they want to reach soon, and then make a plan to reach it. After some time, have students talk about their progress, what worked, what didn't, and what they learned.</li></ul><ul id=""""><li id="""">Team-Building Exercises: Plan activities where students can work together, solve problems, and support each other. These exercises can help students trust each other, communicate better, and feel more confident in their ability to work as a team</li></ul><ul id=""""><li id="""">Positive Affirmations: Have students make a list of positive affirmations about themselves and their abilities. Encourage them to read these affirmations out loud or quietly to themselves, especially when they're feeling unsure or down. This activity can help students believe in themselves and feel more confident.<br>‍</li></ul><h4 id="""">Key Takeaways</h4><p id="""">Building confidence in students is important for their success in school. As teachers, it's our job to create a safe learning environment where students feel comfortable. It’s also important to support students when they make mistakes, and help them set learning goals to build their confidence. Encouragement and positive feedback also play a key role in motivating students, making them feel good about coming to class. Adding confidence building activities to your lesson will further develop your students’ self-esteem and help them rise to the top! By spending time and effort on building confidence in students, we are, in fact, creating the leaders of tomorrow!</p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">Empower the leaders of tomorrow by incorporating confidence-building activities in your classroom!

Yes, it’s important that you start to gauge your student’s academic levels and needs, but building connections with your student and with their guardian(s) is what will make you all more confident in your sessions moving forward.</p><p id="""">Regardless of whether you choose to implement some or all of my suggestions, make sure that when meeting your student for the very first time, you open up a space for them to <strong id="""">ask questions, share their interests and goals, and bond with you as a mentor</strong>.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h4 id="""">BEFORE THE SESSION:</h4><h5 id="""">1. Get to Know your Student through their Parent/Guardian (and maybe even their teacher!)</h5><p id="""">The best way to learn about your new student’s personality and tutoring needs is to speak to the people in their life every day; namely, a parent or guardian. Having a phone call or online meeting will enable you to 1) ask all of your questions and 2) start forming a relationship with your student’s family, both of which will be invaluable to you as you continue on in your tutoring journey. If you’re not sure what to discuss, <a href=""https://help.learntobe.org/article/147-parentquestions"" target=""_blank"" id="""">here are some examples</a> of useful introductory questions to ask:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Are there any additional details I should know about what material [student] needs help with?</li><li id="""">Have you noticed if they have a learning style that suits them best (i.e. visual learning, auditory learning, or hands-on learning)?</li><li id="""">What are their interests and hobbies?</li><li id="""">What is the best way to communicate with you in the future — via email, call, or text?</li><li id="""">Would you be open to sending me their teacher’s contact information so that I can learn a little more about what they’re working on in school?</li></ul><p id="""">If their guardian is willing to connect you with a teacher and that teacher is open to speaking with you, count yourself incredibly lucky! This is your opportunity to get <strong id="""">more in-depth details on your student’s knowledge</strong> of the tutoring subject and what you should focus on to help your student thrive at school and beyond.</p><h5 id="""">2. Have Backup Plans in Place</h5><p id="""">Based on your conversation with your student’s guardian (and/or their teacher) and any other information you have about the student, you’ll want to go ahead and make a plan for your first session (see the following section for ideas). However, as a new tutor, <strong id="""">it’s incredibly important that you have some materials planned as backups</strong> if it turns out that your student isn’t at the learning level that you assume they are. If they are in the fourth grade, for instance, and you’re collecting some multiplication worksheets, you’ll also want to have a few backups on hand intended for second, third, and fifth graders. If you’re working on reading, make sure to have several different books available.</p><p id="""">A huge purpose of the first session is to help your student feel comfortable, and part of that is ensuring that they’re not staring at material that is too difficult or easy for them, stuck feeling nervous or bored. By having backup activities, you guarantee that you will be able to support your student with the resources that they need, as well as getting a better sense of what lessons to plan moving forward.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h4 id="""">DURING THE SESSION:</h4><h5 id="""">1. Play icebreaker games!</h5><p id="""">You should set aside a few minutes every single week to simply chat with your student, but — particularly if they’re on the younger side — they may feel shy about speaking when they’re just getting to know you. An <a href=""https://help.learntobe.org/article/146-icebreakers"" target=""_blank"" id="""">icebreaker game </a>can never hurt to break the ice, so choose one that can be implemented virtually and make it one of the first activities that you complete with your student!</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Charades, tic-tac-toe, 20 questions, or Pictionary</strong> can all make for great introductory games to get you and your student laughing and interacting. For older students, or students who are naturally more extraverted, you might also try including some <a href=""https://help.learntobe.org/article/31-studentquestions"" target=""_blank"" id="""">icebreaker questions </a>in your session, asking them about their friends, hobbies, learning styles…and anything else that pops up! Here are some ideas for conversation starters:</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">What is one fun fact about yourself that people are always be surprised to hear?</li><li id="""">What are some of your favorite books, movies, and television shows?</li><li id="""">Do you play any sports? If so, which one(s)?</li><li id="""">What else do you like to do in your free time? What does a typical day look like for you?</li><li id="""">What’s your favorite class in school, and why do you like that subject?</li><li id="""">What specific topics that you’d like to work on together?</li></ol><p id="""">No matter which questions you choose to ask, <strong id="""">make sure you intersperse them throughout the session</strong> so that your student feels less like they’re being interviewed and more as though they’re participating in a conversation.</p><h5 id="""">2. Set goals with your student</h5><p id="""">Before you launch into academics, you want to ensure that you’re creating the right atmosphere for focused learning. I recommend asking older students — in middle school and above — to share the reason they signed up for tutoring.</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><em id="""">Are they trying to increase test scores or receive a better grade in a class?</em></li><li id=""""><em id="""">Is there a specific subject or unit in school that they’re hoping to improve in?</em></li><li id=""""><em id="""">Do they love learning and simply want academic challenges that they are not able to receive in class?</em></li></ul><p id="""">Write down their “why” for tutoring and make a commitment to checking in on their goal every now and then. Younger students can absolutely participate in goal-setting, too! In fact, it’s a great way to increase their excitement and self-motivation for their studying. Instead of setting a larger goal that may seem more foreign to them, write down an overall goal only for yourself (for example, “learning how to read chapter books”) and work with the student to set short-term, easily attainable goals every month (for example, you could choose “learning the alphabet,” “learning 5 more sight words,” etc). Make sure the student is involved in this choice; <strong id="""">by letting them help set the direction of their tutoring, they’ll become deeply invested in the material that they’re learning</strong>.</p><p id="""">Lastly, don’t let goal-setting get in the way of highlighting their achievements! Whenever you pull out your goals, make sure you encourage your student by helping them describe what they have learned with you over the past few weeks. Not only will they be proud of their work, but by letting them think through and describe their accomplishments on their own, you’ll be teaching them a lesson in self-confidence and motivation that will stick with them for a lifetime.</p><h5 id="""">3. Explore the online classroom</h5><p id="""">At this point in the pandemic, many of us are already familiar with Zoom and other virtual meeting platforms, but it can never hurt to revisit the features that you plan on using most often. If you plan to use the whiteboard feature, show them how to view it and make sure they’re able to write on it; if you are going to be sharing your screen, confirm that you both are seeing the proper screen…and so on. For younger kids, for whom this may be their first time navigating an online space on their own, having this practice time can be incredibly important. You can even <strong id="""">try</strong> <strong id="""">logging out and back in</strong> to make sure your student knows how to access the correct links and connect to the meeting!</p><p id="""">You will save countless time by ensuring that you and your student are confident using all of the tools in your virtual toolbox. Spend just a few minutes on this during your first session, and see what a difference it makes next time!</p><p id="""">For older students, you might try teaching them slightly more advanced strategies. For instance, show them how to split their screen so that they can see you on one side and another website — possibly a worksheet, or an online activity — on the other. Or, <strong id="""">create a shared Google Drive folder</strong> to share any learning materials that you may want to pass back and forth. The sky’s the limit!</p><h5 id="""">4. Introduce your subject!</h5><p id="""">The first session should be primarily focused on building a relationship with your student, whether that’s through goal-setting, ice-breaker games, casual conversations, or more. However, you’ll want to <strong id="""">dedicate at least 10 minutes or so to introducing the subject</strong> you’ll be working on together. As I discussed earlier, you’ll want to have backup plans that you can pull from as the session progresses. You don’t have to really dive deep into the academics, but it’ll help set you up for the following week.</p><p id="""">Don’t feel the need to stick to one specific subtopic in your first meeting, either; the goal is to get a better sense of what knowledge your student already holds and what areas they may need the most help in. So think big! If you’re teaching reading to a kindergartner, you might first see how she is with rhyming patterns and blending sounds together. Then, have her try reading the alphabet, or practicing sight words. You could even read a book to her to see how her comprehension is when listening to someone else read.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">And that’s a wrap on your first session!</strong> With a little bit of preparation, you’ll be on your way to success in no time. It is so much easier to plan for future sessions after you have one already under your belt, so congratulate yourself on work well done and get excited for all of the memories you’ll make with your student!<a href=""https://medium.com/tag/online-tutoring?source=post_page-----b5bb071e9bda---------------online_tutoring-----------------"" id=""""><br></a></p><p id="""">‍</p>"

You may know the topic like the back of your hand, but the question remains… <em id="""">how are you going to explain it?</em></p><p id="""">You probably begin with some research — googling, reading, asking for advice. And then you come across the most amazing online video that explains the topic perfectly and in simple terms. <em id="""">How could you possibly explain it better?</em></p><p id="""">You want to show this to your student and then you think… <em id="""">wait, is this cheating? Should I be explaining it myself with some of my own examples</em>? Well, I am here to tell you that you should not be thinking this way! <strong id="""">It’s OK to use videos to explain concepts in your tutoring sessions!</strong></p><p id="""">This post will walk you through why it’s OK to use videos in your tutoring sessions, and some best practices for doing it right. I’ll cover the following:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Engaging Students While Watching Videos: </strong>Making sure your student stays focused while using videos.</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Where to Find Videos to Use with your Student:</strong> Some of my favorite sites to find helpful videos!</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Step-by-Step Examples:</strong> I’ll show you some specific examples of how I’ve used videos in my lessons with students.</li></ul><h4 id="""">Engaging Students While Watching Videos</h4><p id="""">We all know that videos are a great tool to support learning, but in order to gain maximum benefit they need to be used in the right way. The key is engagement. From the Covid-19 Pandemic we all know that zoning out during online learning is effortless, but when you are engaged in learning your attention remains. So how do you engage your student while watching a video?</p><p id="""">Just some ideas include:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Pausing after every new concept is shown and discussing what you saw.</li><li id="""">If there are sample questions, try solving them on your own before the video goes through the steps. Then discuss after.</li><li id="""">Find or create worksheets that compliment the videos you show and pause throughout to practice.</li></ul><p id="""">The reality is that every student learns differently and videos are not effective for everyone. The best way to determine if this is the right way for your student to learn is through the use of progress checks. After videos, use worksheets to confirm your students’ understanding. And don’t forget the simplest way to determine if it’s the right fit — ask! If your student is not enjoying the use of videos in your sessions, they should let you know!</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Where to Find Videos to Use with your Student:</strong></h4><p id="""">Here are some of my favorite websites where you can find more videos to use with your student:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><a href=""https://www.khanacademy.org/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Khan Academy</a>: This website provides videos in nearly any subject for all grade levels and has the additional benefit of coming with extra practice problems with explanations.</li><li id=""""><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb2GCoLSBXjmI_Qj1vk-44g"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Amoeba Sisters</a>: YouTube channel that provides easy-to-follow, engaging videos on biology concepts.

Reemphasize the line “we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal” from the Declaration of Independence.

The test, taken by 9-year-olds nationwide, showed math scores plunging by seven points from pre-pandemic levels, and reading scores sunk five points, erasing roughly two decades of academic progress. Without consistent exposure to key topics and concepts, children forget what they learned which makes learning new topics even more difficult. However, resources like summer school, summer reading programs, summer math programs, and academic summer camps can help review and reinforce key topics from the year before.</p><p id="""">‍</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Why Summer Tutoring Is So Important<br></strong></h4><p id="""">One of the main reasons why <a href=""https://striveacademics.com/academic-tutoring/"">summer tutoring</a> programs are so beneficial is because it not only allows your child to revisit past concepts but it also fills in any gaps in knowledge from the previous year. Students have different ways of learning, and sometimes, a lack of one-on-one teaching during the school year can lead to students falling behind in class. On average, a student <a href=""http://www.wallacefoundation.org/knowledge-center/Documents/Making-Summer-Count-How-Summer-Programs-Can-Boost-Childrens-Learning.pdf"" id="""">loses a month of subject knowledge</a> during the summer. That means that some children lose much more than a month’s worth of information and may start the next year significantly behind.</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><br>“Two-thirds of teachers polled in a recent survey said they spend at least a month reteaching students old material when they return from summer vacation.""&nbsp;</strong></p><p id="""">- Nora Fleming, <a href=""https://www.edweek.org/education/after-summer-teachers-spend-a-month-reteaching-students/2013/06"" id="""">""After Summer, Teachers Spend a Month Reteaching Students""<br>‍</a></p><p id="""">Sometimes students lose their interest in learning during the school year. This happens at every grade level among struggling students and high-achieving students alike. Sometimes during the school year student and teachers have to move quickly through the material to stay on track and meet the deadlines of the curriculum. Thankfully, tutoring over the summer doesn’t have to be as regimented if the student needs a different pace or something else altogether. Tutoring can help your child explore the areas of each subject that interest them more, and engage them with projects and assignments that will captivate their attention. One of the things that children love to learn is how each subject relates to real-world applications. The best summer tutoring provides an avenue for your child to explore subjects in a more engaging way that will get them excited about learning.</p><h4 id=""""><br>Practice. Practice. Practice.<strong id="""">‍</strong></h4><p id=""""><strong id="""">‍</strong>Even if you think your child has a strong memory and grasp on their course work, summer tutoring can help them master their learning skills. Summer tutoring allows children to practice skills that aren't always taught in-depth but are fundamental. Tutors can give students exercises and projects that practice skills such as note-taking, organization, active listening, writing, reading comprehension, critical thinking, and more.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">‍</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Learn To Be Summer Camp 2023</strong>‍</h4><p id="""">Knowing that summer is often a time when children fall behind, we want to offer students affordable tutoring programs to stay on track this summer.

Over the past decade alone, the number of homeless children has swelled from 1.5 to 2.5 million (The National Center on Family Homelessness, 2014).</p><p id="""">What does education look like for students who find themselves on the streets? Children experiencing homelessness are four times more likely to show delayed development, and develop learning disabilities at twice the rate of non-homeless children. While initiatives like the McKinney-Vento Homelessness Assistance Act have given homeless children a greater chance of achieving educational stability, performance analysis reveals that only 21.5% and 24.4% of homeless students are proficient in math and reading. Scores worsen for high school students, with 11.4% and 14.6% proficiency in math and reading (National Center on Family Homelessness, 2009). These statistics represent a fundamental human rights issue because an effective education is essential for the exercise of all other human rights. Indeed, it empowers people to exercise their freedom, participate in the body politic, and achieve their potential.</p><p id="""">Learn to Be exists for the express purpose of bridging these educational disparities via access to quality educational assistance wherever it is needed. The incorporation of technology combined with strategic partnerships is helping Learn To Be provide truly accessible learning opportunities for those who need them most in order to close the education gap for homeless students in innovative new ways. Imagine a tutor from Iowa, sitting at a cafe on a portable device, helping a homeless student at a Los Angeles shelter learn his multiplication facts through the LTB online platform. Or a college student in her dorm in Austin helping a student at an elementary school in LA learn how to read.</p><p id="""">This is what Learn To Be tutors have been doing since 2009. Our tutors are like-minded individuals committed to quality education who continue to help students through our university chapters, and more recently, unique partnerships with primary schools.</p><p id="""">With Schools on Wheels, for example, Learn to Be has begun offering online tutoring sessions to bridge the educational gap in homeless students in the state of California — where 300,000 children experience homelessness each year ranking it among the worst states in the country (The National Center on Family Homelessness, 2014). Homelessness prevents these children from getting the academic stability and help they desperately need. Together, Schools on Wheels and Learn To Be work one-on-one with children in grades 2 through 8 on basic math, reading, writing, and science several times a week.</p><p id="""">The core of our efforts stem from the tutors who come from all backgrounds and professions, with a shared goal — to reach out to a child, to teach, to mentor, and assist in their educational life.

Sounds thrilling, I know, but trust me when I say that I love what I do. Nevermind the fact that I can come to work when I want, can wear what I want, and can leave when I want — the entire course of my day is driven by my own curiosity and my own pursuit of knowledge. I go (for the most part) where my mind takes me. And boy, does it take me places. Although I spend most (sorry advisors) of my time on my research, a few years ago I started to think about how I could use that research and my decades-long education to give back. And if we are being honest, I wish this were something I could’ve thought about earlier in life.</p><p id="""">See, I was born into a family with parents who told me that I could be the first person to step foot on Mars, that I could actually aid in finding life elsewhere in the Solar System and that hard work and a good education could unleash an endless sea of opportunity. This mindset became part of my being. Lost in the depths of my brain, I didn’t realize how convolved it was with my everyday life. Yet, the classes I took, the friends I made, the college I went to, were all subconsciously predicated around the idea that I would surround myself with equal-minded, driven, intelligent people. And, this was black and white for me because my hard work was always complimented by good grades, praise from teachers, a college acceptance letter, etc. So to me, hard work = success. Simple, right?</p><p id="""">It wasn’t until my younger sister (11 years apart) entered elementary school that I began to realize the complexity of my previous statement. Early on, the things that were easy for me were difficult for her. We were taught using identical techniques but she had a rough time getting acclimated to the CA public school system. She was put with other kids who were also deemed “slow learners” (don’t get me started on this…) and then it seemed like her fate was set. She lost confidence in herself and despite my parents attempt to help her, she started falling behind. My parents talked to the teachers, helped her with homework, got her tested for learning disabilities and years later, she is finally coming around as she enters high school.</p><p id="""">In this whole process I learned just how swamped the public school teachers are. The teachers were unable to provide my sister the one-on-one attention she needed; so instead of figuring out what learning strategies worked for her, they put her in slower classes and let her and many other students fall behind. Even in the San Ramon Valley School District- whose students rank in the 5–10% statewide on multiple performance measures- classes average 26 students to 1 teacher. This is one of the best-case scenarios. Also, if you go to the SRVSD website, there is a note that says the parents volunteer over 300,000 hours of volunteer service! It also says that middle school class sizes have been reduced through funds raised by the community. So if students can get lost in the cream-of-the-crop public education system, what about the communities in which parents are too busy earning just enough to feed their kids, and so giving time or money to the school is not an option? What about the parents who can’t help their kids with their homework because they don’t have an education themselves? The list goes on, but my point is clear: the disparity between affluent and underserved communities is mind blowing. And as a graduate student who has had the privilege of being the product of fantastic education and parents who could help me with my homework, I became a tutor for Learn to Be so that I could try and provide <strong id="""">all kids</strong> with that same innate mindset and love for learning that my parents instilled in me.</p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">“Learn to Be builds the dire bridge between people and the exponential growth of technology.”</em></strong></p><p id="""">A few months ago Bill and Melinda Gates published a CNN article where they set their bets for 2030. One of their bets was as following:</p><p id="""">“As high-speed cell networks grow and smartphones become as cheap as today’s voice-only phones, online education will flourish“</p><p id="""">They followed up by saying that kids will be able to learn numbers and letters from smartphones and that software will be able to tell if a student is having trouble learning and adjust to his/her pace. But that software, of course, can never replace teachers. They added that teachers could upload videos online to help students learn. Videos are fantastic tools (I used MIT courseware all throughout college) but I can’t help but laugh at the idea of telling a struggling teenager who has lost faith in their ability to learn to spend their afternoons watching math videos. Learn to Be builds the dire bridge between people and the exponential growth of technology. I am able to talk to my students face-to-face, understand why they are struggling in school, and personalize my teaching plan to their needs. And the best part about it is that ANYONE can do this. My once struggling sister, now entering high school, is a Learn to Be tutor herself, helping a young homeless 6th grader with division. There are a little over 4,000 colleges in the US, which enroll about 21 million students. The average American spends about 280 minutes on Facebook a week. It takes 60 minutes a week to help out a student. Our potential is so enormous that, Bill and Melinda Gates (I am talking to you), this is how we make online education flourish. It’s not going to be the latest app or the videos posted by teachers, it’s going to be the dedication of a generation of people determined to provide individual personalized attention to underserved students around the nation.</p><p id="""">Written by Natasha Batalha.</p><p id="""">‍</p>"

Learn To Be is proud to be a PVSA Certifying Organization.,By Dan Solt,"<p id=""""><strong id=""""><em id="""">PVSA Temporarily Paused: </em></strong><em id="""">As of May 27, 2025, the PVSA program is paused due to federal funding cuts to AmeriCorps. This means Learn To Be cannot currently process or distribute awards. This is outside of our control, but we’re ready to issue awards as soon as the program resumes. Thank you for your service and understanding.</em></p><p>-----</p><p id="""">The Presidential Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) recognizes volunteers that are committed to helping others. Here at Learn To Be, we pride ourselves on being a PVSA Certifying Organization. Tutoring with us is one of the easiest ways to help those in need and earn the PVSA.</p><p id="""">Since 2003, the PVSA has been celebrating volunteers all across the United States. The award enables Certifying Organizations (like<a href=""https://www.learntobe.org/apply"" id=""""> Learn To Be</a>!) to reward volunteers for their commitment and dedication to serving their community. In the past, Learn To Be tutors have put this volunteer service award on scholarship applications, college applications, medical school applications, and job resumes.</p><h2 id="""">What are the Presidential Volunteer Service Award Requirements?</h2><p id="""">To qualify for the PVSA, you must meet the hour and service requirements. The PVSA award level achieved varies based on age and hours logged. The different levels of the award are bronze, silver, gold, and the President's Lifetime Achievement Award. The Lifetime Achievement Award honors individuals who complete over 4,000 hours of service in their lifetime.</p><p id="""">Here is a breakdown of how many hours you need to volunteer in order to receive a PVSA depending on your age:</p><p id="""">‍</p><figure id="""" class=""w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center"" data-rt-type=""image"" data-rt-align=""center""><div id=""""><img src=""https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6591cfa135e450f1bb1af9c9/66e1c345f2ccaea3eeb49a2a_6594e0c83eefb52c0b523de2_Screenshot%25202024-01-02%2520at%25208.21.13%25E2%2580%25AFPM.png"" loading=""lazy"" id="""" width=""auto"" height=""auto"" alt=""Chart showing hours required in each age group to earn awards""></div></figure><p id="""">Tracking every hour you spend volunteering is necessary to qualify for the reward. Other organizations may supply you with an hours tracking sheet or you can find a template to help you here. Once you have completed the volunteer hours, submit them to your PVSA organization. The organization will review and verify the hours before submitting them to the PVSA. At Learn To Be, we make this task easy by tracking and monitoring hours in your tutoring account.</p><h2 id="""">What Are PVSA Certifying Organizations?</h2><p id="""">Learn To Be is one of the few organizations that meets the requirements and is approved by the PVSA program, known as a Certifying Organization. Requirements for these organizations include:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Verifying volunteer service hours</li><li id="""">Taking the Certifying Organization e-course</li><li id="""">Conducting business ethically</li><li id="""">Maintaining a database of volunteer information</li></ul><p id="""">Not all volunteer organizations meet these criteria and only those that are certified can be eligible to provide you with the Presidential Volunteer Service Award. A full list of requirements can be found here.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Why Choose Virtual Volunteering and Online Tutoring Opportunities</strong></h2><p id="""">When it comes to the exact nature of your volunteering, there is a wide variety of choices. Most people look for something that has the largest impact on the people they are helping in a short time. Tutoring has the potential to change lives and shape futures. When you help underserved kids do better in school, you can change the course of their lives. We think relationships really matter. That’s why at Learn To Be, you’ll work 1-on-1 with the same student each week, for as long as you need to help them reach their goals. The subject you tutor is up to you!</p><p id="""">In the past, the number of tutor volunteering opportunities available depended on where you lived. You couldn't tutor anyone unless you were in the same room as them. Now that tutoring online is common, organizations like ours make it easy to help others. No matter where you live we give tutors like you the opportunity to use their skills to help students in need.</p><h2 id=""""><strong id="""">Learn To Be is a PVSA Certifying Organization</strong></h2><p id="""">Learn To Be is a Certifying Organization that can provide you with a great opportunity to achieve the presidental award for volunteering, regardless of your location.

I&nbsp;wasn't giving up my time to tutor 3 students. And when I did volunteer, I certainly wasn't able to articulate its impact on me like this young tutor did. I'm just so impressed with how engaged our high school tutors are. It's amazing to see.</p><p id="""">When we started Learn To Be, we didn't allow high school tutors. We thought they were too young to be effective. How wrong I was! High school students are the backbone of our tutoring cohort and those who come through are so wonderful. They have a contagious enthusiasm and that's 90% of the battle when tutoring. </p><p id="""">If you're interested in joining Learn To Be as a online, volunteer tutor, please visit <a href=""https://www.learntobe.org/apply"">https://learntobe.org/apply</a></p><p id="""">‍</p><p id="""">‍</p>"
