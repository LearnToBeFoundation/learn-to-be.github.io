<p>Automaticity might be one of the most important concepts in the
science of learning that most people have never heard of. Yet it’s the
invisible foundation that determines whether a student will struggle or
soar in their academic journey.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-automaticity">What is Automaticity?</h2>
<p>Automaticity is the ability to perform a skill so fluently and
effortlessly that it requires minimal conscious attention. When
something becomes automatic, your brain can execute it while
simultaneously focusing on higher-order thinking.</p>
<p>Think about driving a car. When you first learned, you had to
consciously think about every action: checking mirrors, signaling,
steering, braking. Your working memory was completely occupied with
these basic operations. But once driving became automatic, you could
navigate while having a conversation, listening to music, or planning
your day.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to learning.</p>
<h2 id="why-automaticity-matters-for-academic-success">Why Automaticity
Matters for Academic Success</h2>
<p>Here’s the crucial insight: <strong>our working memory is severely
limited</strong>. Cognitive scientists tell us we can only hold about
4-7 pieces of information in our conscious awareness at any given time.
This creates a fundamental bottleneck in learning.</p>
<p>When students haven’t developed automaticity in foundational skills,
their limited working memory gets consumed by basic operations, leaving
no mental space for higher-order thinking, problem-solving, or
creativity.</p>
<h3 id="the-math-example">The Math Example</h3>
<p>Consider a middle school student trying to solve this word
problem:</p>
<p><em>“Sarah has 3/4 of a pizza. She eats 1/6 of the whole pizza. How
much pizza does she have left?”</em></p>
<p>A student without automatic recall of fraction operations must use
their working memory to: - Remember how to find common denominators -
Recall the steps for subtracting fractions - Convert between mixed
numbers and improper fractions - Keep track of the problem context</p>
<p>By the time they’ve worked through the mechanical steps, they’ve
often lost sight of what the problem was actually asking. Their working
memory was hijacked by computational procedures that should have been
automatic.</p>
<p>In contrast, a student with automatic fraction skills can immediately
focus on the problem-solving strategy, the reasonableness of their
answer, and the mathematical relationships at play.</p>
<h2 id="why-kids-struggle-in-math-and-other-subjects">Why Kids Struggle
in Math (And Other Subjects)</h2>
<p>This is exactly why so many students hit a wall in mathematics around
middle school. Elementary math focuses heavily on building computational
fluency, but many students never achieve true automaticity with basic
facts and procedures.</p>
<p>When they encounter algebra, geometry, or more complex
problem-solving, they’re trying to learn new concepts while
simultaneously wrestling with arithmetic that should be effortless. It’s
like trying to write poetry while still sounding out individual
letters.</p>
<p>The same pattern appears across subjects: - <strong>Reading
comprehension</strong> suffers when students haven’t automated word
recognition - <strong>Writing</strong> becomes laborious when spelling
and grammar aren’t automatic - <strong>Science</strong> problem-solving
stalls when mathematical operations require conscious effort</p>
<h2 id="the-learn-to-be-approach-practice-practice-practice">The Learn
To Be Approach: Practice, Practice, Practice</h2>
<p>This is why at <a href="https://www.learntobe.org">Learn To Be</a>,
we emphasize practicing fundamentals until they become second nature.
We’re not being old-fashioned or drill-obsessed—we’re following what
cognitive science tells us about how learning actually works.</p>
<p>Our tutors understand that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Fluency comes before complexity</strong>: Students need
automatic recall of math facts before tackling multi-step problems</li>
<li><strong>Repetition builds neural pathways</strong>: The brain
literally rewires itself through deliberate practice</li>
<li><strong>Speed matters</strong>: True automaticity means both
accuracy AND speed</li>
<li><strong>Regular review prevents decay</strong>: Skills that aren’t
maintained will lose their automatic quality</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-this-looks-like-in-practice">What This Looks Like in
Practice</h3>
<p>When our tutors work with students, they:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assess automaticity gaps</strong>: Before moving to new
concepts, we identify which foundational skills need strengthening</li>
<li><strong>Use spaced repetition</strong>: We revisit basic skills
regularly to maintain automaticity</li>
<li><strong>Set fluency benchmarks</strong>: Students practice until
they can perform skills quickly and accurately</li>
<li><strong>Connect basics to bigger picture</strong>: We help students
see how automatic skills enable more interesting problem-solving</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-broader-implications">The Broader Implications</h2>
<p>Automaticity isn’t just about academic subjects—it’s about how
expertise develops in any domain. Musicians practice scales until
they’re automatic so they can focus on musical expression. Athletes
drill fundamental movements so they can react instinctively in
competition. Surgeons practice basic procedures until they become second
nature, freeing their minds to handle unexpected complications.</p>
<p>The pattern is universal: <strong>automaticity in fundamentals
enables excellence in advanced skills</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="building-automaticity-key-principles">Building Automaticity: Key
Principles</h2>
<p>If you’re a parent, teacher, or tutor, here are the key principles
for building automaticity:</p>
<h3 id="identify-the-true-fundamentals">1. Identify the True
Fundamentals</h3>
<p>Not everything needs to be automatic, but certain foundational skills
absolutely must be. In math, this includes: - Single-digit addition and
subtraction facts - Multiplication tables through 12x12 - Basic fraction
operations - Place value concepts</p>
<h3 id="practice-to-fluency-not-just-accuracy">2. Practice to Fluency,
Not Just Accuracy</h3>
<p>A student who can eventually get the right answer isn’t the same as a
student who can quickly and effortlessly get the right answer. Aim for
both speed and accuracy.</p>
<h3 id="use-distributed-practice">3. Use Distributed Practice</h3>
<p>Short, frequent practice sessions are more effective than long,
infrequent ones. Ten minutes of daily practice beats an hour once a
week.</p>
<h3 id="make-it-engaging">4. Make It Engaging</h3>
<p>Automaticity requires repetition, but repetition doesn’t have to be
boring. Use games, competitions, and varied formats to maintain
motivation.</p>
<h3 id="monitor-and-maintain">5. Monitor and Maintain</h3>
<p>Automaticity can decay without use. Regularly revisit foundational
skills even as students advance to new topics.</p>
<h2 id="the-long-term-payoff">The Long-Term Payoff</h2>
<p>Students who develop strong automaticity in foundational skills
experience a cascade of benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased confidence</strong>: Success becomes more
predictable when basics are solid</li>
<li><strong>Better problem-solving</strong>: Mental resources are freed
up for strategic thinking</li>
<li><strong>Faster learning</strong>: New concepts build more easily on
automatic foundations</li>
<li><strong>Reduced anxiety</strong>: Students feel more in control when
they’re not struggling with basics</li>
<li><strong>Greater enjoyment</strong>: Learning becomes more engaging
when cognitive load is manageable</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Automaticity might not be the most exciting topic in education, but
it’s arguably the most important. It’s the difference between students
who struggle and students who thrive, between those who see learning as
a burden and those who see it as an adventure.</p>
<p>At Learn To Be, we’ve seen countless students transform when they
finally achieve automaticity in foundational skills. Suddenly, math
makes sense. Reading becomes enjoyable. Learning accelerates.</p>
<p>The path to academic excellence doesn’t start with advanced concepts
or creative projects—it starts with making the basics so automatic that
students’ minds are free to soar.</p>

<p>I will assume this isn’t your first session. Check out this post on
how to structure your first tutoring session.</p>
<p>Here are the steps to structure a tutoring session:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Plan bite-sized lessons ahead of time.</li>
<li>Do some retrieval practice from the previous session.</li>
<li>Use your lessons to do “I do, we do, you do”</li>
<li>Do some retrieval practice from the current session.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s go through these steps in detail.</p>
<h2 id="plan-bite-sized-lessons-ahead-of-time">Plan bite-sized lessons
ahead of time</h2>
<p>It’s important that the lessons you plan are bite-sized. This means
that you should plan to cover one or two concepts in each lesson. This
will make it easier for the student to understand and remember the
material.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say your student is learning about adding
fractions. There are a lot of ways to practice. For example, you could
create a single lesson that has problems like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><span class="math inline">\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} =
?</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} =
?</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{5} =
?</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\frac{7}{5} + \frac{1}{6} =
?</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>What would be the issue if we just had one lesson with these
problems? And could we break this lesson into two smaller lessons?</p>
<p>Yes! I think there could be many lessons created from this: 1. Adding
fractions with the same denominator 2. Adding fractions with different
denominators 3. Adding mixed numbers 4. Adding improper fractions 5.
Adding fractions that need to be reduced</p>
<h3 id="ok-but-how-do-you-actually-create-a-bite-sized-lesson">Ok but
how do you actually create a bite-sized lesson?</h3>
<p>You can structure a lesson in the following way:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A tutorial of sorts. This could be some written text or a video or
just a conversation. The goal is to explain the single concept.</li>
<li>A few examples on that topic.</li>
<li>7-10 problems on that topic.</li>
</ol>

<p>Before we dive into how to teach most effectively, we have to get rid
of some myths. If you’re a tutor at Learn To Be, you need to know
these.</p>
<h2
id="myth-1-students-learn-better-when-taught-in-their-preferred-learning-style.">Myth
1: “Student’s learn better when taught in their preferred learning
style.”</h2>
<p>This is one that has become so deeply ingrained in our heads but we
need to stop. If you’re a tutor at Learn To Be, you have to know this
one: there is no evidence that students have different learning styles.
Students who say they’re visual learners vs oral learners vs
kinaesthetic learners do not learn better when taught in their preferred
mode.</p>
<p>What IS true is that some material is better in certain ways. For
example, if you’re teaching geometry, you should use diagrams. If you’re
teaching phonics, you should use sound. If you’re teaching history, you
might just use words. Or you might use diagrams.</p>
<p>But regardless of the content, there is no evidence that students
learn better when taught in their preferred mode.</p>
<p><em>What happens if a parent or student says they are a visual
learner?</em> Listen to them, no need to tell them otehrwise. But use
what’s taught in this tutor training to teach according to the
content.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more learning styles, check out this <a
href="https://www.justinmath.com/people-differ-in-learning-speed-not-learning-style/">article
by Justin Skycak</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="myth-2-kids-learn-at-the-same-pace">Myth 2: “Kids learn at the
same pace”</h2>
<p>Almost every kid has a huge ceiling on their potential. But some will
have to work harder to get there. You might be tutoring two kids in
their times tables. One kid seems to be memorizing them faster than the
other. And that’s ok. That will be the case. Some people learn faster
than others.</p>
<p>As a tutor, it will be up to you to keep the student who is learning
a little bit slower motivated. We’ll talk more about how to do that in
this tutor training.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more learning styles and learning speeds, check
out this <a
href="https://www.justinmath.com/people-differ-in-learning-speed-not-learning-style/">article
by Justin Skycak</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="myth-3-learning-should-feel-easy">Myth 3: “Learning should feel
easy”</h2>
<p>It’s actually the opposite! Learning should feel hard. When you’re
asked a question, how you know you’ve learned it is if you can tease it
out of your brain. And in the early stages of learning something, that
can be hard.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="myth-4-highlight-reread-cram-good-study-habits">Myth 4:
“Highlight, reread, cram = good study habits”</h2>
<p>If you want to get an A on a test that’s coming up in a few days,
then <em>maybe</em> highlighting, rereading, and cramming will work. But
if you want to learn something for the long term, then this will never,
ever work.</p>
<p>For long term learning, it’s actually important to study something
and then put it away and come back to it later (maybe a day or two
later) and then test yourself on it. This is called “spaced
repetition”.</p>
<p>You space out your learning. So, for example, let’s say you learn a
new random fact like “the capital of Canada is Ottawa.” What you
traditionally have been told to do is to make a flashcard or something
and just drill this fact over and over again.</p>
<p>But if you’re smart about it, you’ll read this fact for a couple of
minutes and then put it away. And then come back to it a day or two
later and test yourself on it. You’ll see if you can pull it out of your
brain. Maybe the first time you look at it again, you won’t remember and
you’ll have to look at the answer. You study a little bit more. And then
you put it away again. And then you come back to it a day or two later
and test yourself on it again. And you keep doing this. Eventually, this
will be committed to your long term memory.</p>
<p>That’s what we mean by “spaced” in spaced repetition. You’re spacing
your studying out.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about this idea of spaced repetition, check
out this <a
href="https://www.justinmath.com/spaced-repetition-is-more-than-memorization-its-also-generalization/">article
by Justin Skycak</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="myth-5-fun-learning">Myth 5: “Fun = learning”</h2>
<p>Engagement helps <strong>attention</strong>, but students can be
engrossed in an activity while thinking about the wrong
thing—speed-typing answers into Kahoot, for instance. Learning only
sticks when their working memory grapples with the <em>meaningful</em>
element of the task.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="myth-6-discovery-learning-works-for-novices">Myth 6: “Discovery
learning works for novices”</h2>
<p>This will be less relevant to you as a tutor, but it’s still
important to know. Some people think that students learn better when
they “discover” things on their own. But this is not true. Students
learn better when they are taught directly. This is called “direct
instruction”. You teach the child directly what they need to know. One
way in which you can do this is via the “I do, we do, you do”
method.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Fiber ↑</strong> — ≈ 40 g /day (half soluble, half
insoluble)<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Saturated fat ↓</strong><br />
</li>
<li>Protein kept ≥ 100 g /day to maintain satiety and lean mass</li>
</ol>
<p>I had previously obsessed over protein and ignored fiber; this flip
made the difference.</p>

<h3 id="smoothie-ingredients">Smoothie ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>8 oz unsweetened soy milk<br />
</li>
<li>30 g Gold Standard whey<br />
</li>
<li>12 g chia seeds (soaked)<br />
</li>
<li>8 g psyllium husk<br />
</li>
<li>16 g peanut-butter powder<br />
</li>
<li>5 g cinnamon<br />
</li>
<li>5 g unsweetened cocoa</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-psyllium">Why psyllium?</h3>
<p>Psyllium husk is mostly <strong>soluble</strong> fiber, which forms a
gel in the gut and helps pull LDL out of circulation.</p>

<h2 id="typical-dinners">Typical Dinners</h2>
<ul>
<li>Indian yellow curry<br />
</li>
<li>Wild salmon + rice + edamame<br />
</li>
<li>Pan-fried scallops<br />
</li>
<li>Indian <strong>daal</strong> (often with extra yogurt)<br />
</li>
<li>Cottage-cheese waffles / pancakes<br />
</li>
<li><em>Sooji</em> (semolina) pancakes<br />
</li>
<li>Korean-flavored tofu stir-fry</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="cheat-meals">Cheat Meals</h2>
<p>I tried to avoid true cheat meals, but my sweet-tooth workaround was
<strong>cottage-cheese waffles</strong>—high protein, low sat-fat, and
you <em>can’t taste</em> the cottage cheese.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="foods-i-missed-couldnt-find-good-substitutes">Foods I Missed
(Couldn’t Find Good Substitutes)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pizza (the cheese!)<br />
</li>
<li>Chocolate<br />
</li>
<li>Donuts<br />
</li>
<li>Butter-heavy cookies &amp; pastries</li>
</ul>
<p>Every “healthy” version I tried tasted like cardboard; I chose
abstinence over disappointment.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<ul>
<li>≈ 10 000 steps/day (light walking burns a few hundred kcal)<br />
</li>
<li>Minimal weights or HIIT—lots of false starts here. I could improve
this phase.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These three months accomplished:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fiber</strong> ∼ 40 g/day<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Sat fat</strong> kept low<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Protein</strong> &gt; 100 g/day</li>
</ul>
<p>Body weight settled at <strong>147 lb</strong> and I feel noticeably
better.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next</h2>
<ul>
<li>Maintain high fiber + protein<br />
</li>
<li>Loosen cheat days (slightly higher sat-fat)<br />
</li>
<li>Ramp up cardio &amp; consistent weight training</li>
</ul>
<p>My hunch: fiber alone did most of the LDL-lowering heavy-lifting.
Time will tell whether LDL stays low once I re-introduce moderate
sat-fat.</p>
