 I can't think of a better sell for why you should join Learn To Be as a tutor than this testimonial left by a young high school student:

  "As a high school student and tutor for the Learn To Be, I have experienced significant personal growth and developed skills that extend far beyond academics. Working with this incredible organization has shaped my understanding of empathy, responsibility, and the importance of hard work.

  Tutoring with Learn to Be has given me a deep sense of empathy and compassion. Learning about the daily struggles of my students has opened my eyes to the diverse challenges they face. This awareness has allowed me to connect with them on a personal level.

  One of the most valuable aspects of my role as a tutor is the responsibility it entails. Crafting lesson plans and keeping organized to track my students' progress have taught me essential skills in time management and organization. Balancing my academic responsibilities, extracurricular activities, and tutoring sessions has reinforced the importance of hard work and dedication.

  Currently, I am privileged to tutor three amazing students. One of my proudest moments was helping a student who initially struggled with Spanish. Through consistent support and tailored lessons, this student now excels in the subject. Witnessing this transformation gives me a profound sense of pride and fulfillment, knowing that my efforts have made a significant difference in their academic journey.

  The support from the Learn To Be team has been instrumental in my development as a tutor. Ms. Jossen Jesalva, in particular, has been a constant source of guidance and encouragement. Her detailed and positive responses to my questions have always lightened my day and helped me navigate challenges with confidence.

  Learn To Be has not only helped me grow as a tutor but also as a person. I am grateful for the opportunity to make a positive impact in the lives of my students and for the continuous support that has helped me thrive. Thank you, Learn To Be, for fostering my growth and allowing me to contribute to the success of others."

 When I was 16 years old, I was pretty clownish. I wasn't giving up my time to tutor 3 students. And when I did volunteer, I certainly wasn't able to articulate its impact on me like this young tutor did. I'm just so impressed with how engaged our high school tutors are. It's amazing to see.

 When we started Learn To Be, we didn't allow high school tutors. We thought they were too young to be effective. How wrong I was! High school students are the backbone of our tutoring cohort and those who come through are so wonderful. They have a contagious enthusiasm and that's 90% of the battle when tutoring.
