## Tell us about your favorite moment tutoring with one of your students.

When I started tutoring one of my students, they were at the 39th percentile for their math benchmark, which is surprisingly low. After around four months of continuous, dedicated tutoring, they ended up having to take another math benchmark. While, naturally, they and their mother were very nervous about their score, they ended up getting placed in the 91st percentile. This gain of around 52% was not only an impressive academic feat but also an incredible self-confidence booster. Seeing this student jump up and down in joy and their mother crying tears of happiness, gratitude, and pride was a life-changing moment for me.

## What kind of impact has Learn To Be tutoring had on you?

Learn To Be has truly been a life-changing experience in the sense that it allowed me to activate my empathy and make a difference in the lives of several students who were not as fortunate as I was. Growing up in India, I know what it feels like to experience a sense of disadvantage compared to your peers. I wanted to help bring about a change in the lives of those kids who might be in a comparable position, and Learn To Be helped me accomplish that.
