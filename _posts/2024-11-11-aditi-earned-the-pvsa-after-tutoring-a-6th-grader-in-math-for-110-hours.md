## Tell us about your favorite moment(s) tutoring with your student(s).

My favorite moments tutoring with my students are seeing their faces light up when they understand a topic thoroughly or answer a question correctly. Seeing them confident in their academics makes me feel joy.

My student's grades have improved, taking them from a C+ to a B+.

## Why did you decide to earn the Presidential Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) through Learn To Be over other organizations?

Learn to Be has inspired me to tutor kids who don't have as many opportunities. I decided to earn my hours through Learn to Be because their mission is great.

Earning the PVSA can help me in the future because I can showcase my dedication to volunteering through this great extracurricular activity that gives back to communities around the US.
