 When I first started tutoring my student, he struggled with multiplication tables and computing arithmetic promptly. However, after several hours of practice with him and repetitive problem-solving, he memorized all his multiplication tables from 1-5. The day he showed up to class solving all the multiplication problems that I was giving him in a matter of seconds provided a level of satisfaction unlike any other. Ever since then, I have pledged myself to go above and beyond for my students.

 Why did you decide to earn the Presidential Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) through Learn To Be over other organizations?
</h2>
<p id="">
 Learn To Be is an inclusive community of tutors that is dedicated to providing tutoring access for children living in underprivileged areas. Earning the PVSA will help LTB expand its platform and make a positive impact on the lives of others, just like it has done on mine!

 How does earning the PVSA help you in your future?
</h2>
<p id="">
 The PVSA will bolster my college application and quantify my contribution to LTB. I will also use it for other summer program applications under the volunteering section!
