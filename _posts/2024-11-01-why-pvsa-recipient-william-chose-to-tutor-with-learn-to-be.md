 What kind of specific impact has your tutoring had on your student?
</h2>
<p id="">
 I had an 11-year-old student who was a foster child who (in her birth family) had missed two years of school. She understood math at a first-grade level. In her foster family she returned to school and met with me twice a week for a year. At the end of that year she said "math is easy" and she was functioning at grade level in math.

 Why did you decide to earn the Presidential Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) through Learn To Be over other organizations?
</h2>
<p id="">
 At Learn to Be, tutors have ongoing relationships with students. Meeting with a child for weeks or months helps that child not only to learn subject matter, but also to develop and mature through their relationship with a safe and supportive adult.

 I am proud of having helped this country in a significant way, and I feel encouraged to do more.

 Anything else you'd like to add?

 Learn to Be makes tutoring logistically easier on both ends, thus allowing me to to do more volunteer tutoring than I otherwise could. Helping struggling students, all of whom can and do learn when given the chance, has enriched my life immeasurably.
