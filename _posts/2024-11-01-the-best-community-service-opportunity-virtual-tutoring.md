Whether you need community service hours for a graduation requirement or to boost a college application, we know finding places to volunteer near you can be a challenge. Luckily today there are many virtual volunteering opportunities that don't require you to leave your home.

‍

Virtual tutoring has become increasingly important, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, where many schools have switched to remote learning. Virtual tutoring helps bridge the educational gap and provides students with the resources they need to succeed. For example, volunteering with us at [Learn To Be](https://www.learntobe.org) allows you to provide 1-on-1 academic help to students in need from the comfort of your own home.

‍


#### Volunteering Near Me 

‍

If you were to search ‘community service hours near me’, the results would be a mix of different organizations in your area. It can be hard and time-consuming to research each organization to figure out if they need your help if they have a role you'd enjoy, and if they qualify to fulfill your hours. It's most likely that you’ll find volunteering opportunities that are not available when you need them or are too far away from where you live.

‍

All of these problems can be avoided by becoming a virtual tutor. Online community service hours count just as much as in-person community service hours. By volunteering with organizations like us at [Learn To Be](https://www.learntobe.org), you can complete your service hours from wherever you are and when it works best for your schedule.

‍


#### Community Service Hours That Make an Impact

‍

Whether you are skilled in science, passionate about poetry, or moved by math, you can help make the lives of underserved kids and their families easier. At [Learn To Be](https://www.learntobe.org), our tutors not only help at-risk students improve their academic performance but also build relationships as they work 1-on-1 with the same student each week. We've seen these relationships help students outside of the class by boosting their self-esteem and creating a positive outlook and social skills. By volunteering to be a virtual tutor you can have a genuine impact that can help shape the rest of a kid’s life.

‍
