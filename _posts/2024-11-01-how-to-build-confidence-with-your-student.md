Our virtual tutors at Learn To Be know how important it is to help students feel confident in their abilities, so that they can do well in school, and in life. In this blog post, we’ll be sharing some tips and tricks for building confidence in students. Let's begin!‍


#### Create a Safe Place to Learn

A safe place to learn is the first step in building confidence in students. It's important to create an environment where students respect and trust one another. An environment where they feel safe enough to ask questions and share their ideas. Here are a few ways to make a safe learning space:

‍

- **Keep an open line of communication:** Make sure students know that they can come to you with anything. Whether it's instances of bullying or just a papercut, they should feel comfortable enough to approach you.

- **Set boundaries:** Make clear rules for how to behave and communicate what will happen if those rules aren't followed. While enforcing rules may seem harsh, it’s important to follow through, otherwise you invite chaos into the classroom.

- **Practice empathy:** Show that you care about your students' problems, both in and out of school. If you notice someone is struggling, ask them about their day, and how they’re doing.


#### Support Students When They Make Mistakes

Mistakes are a natural part of the learning process, and it's important to be supportive when they happen. Instead of focusing on their mistake, discuss how students can learn and grow from the experience. Help them see their mistakes as a learning opportunity rather than a failure. Explain the importance of trusting the process and being persistent.‍


#### Help Students Set Clear Learning Goals

Helping students set clear, actionable learning goals can help them build confidence in their abilities. Help your students identify key areas they need to work on and come up with a strategy to work on them. Check in with them regularly and modify the goals as needed. Celebrate their progress and discuss any challenges that arise.

#### Different Ways to Provide Constructive Feedback

Providing helpful feedback is important for building confidence in students. Here are some tips for giving feedback that supports growth:

‍

- Be specific: Clearly say what the student did well and what they can do better.

- Focus on the task, not the person: Keep feedback about the work, not about the students themselves.

- Be timely: Give feedback as soon as you can after the work is done so it's more helpful and meaningful.

- Offer suggestions: Don't just point out problems, give ideas on how the student can improve.


#### The Power of Encouragement

Don't forget how important it is to encourage students. Simple things like a smile, a pat on the back, or a few kind words can really help motivate students to do better. As a virtual tutor, remember to celebrate your students' success, no matter how small, and help them be proud of their progress.‍


#### Fun Confidence Building Activities for Class

Adding confidence building activities to your lessons can be a fun way of building confidence in students. Here are a few activities you can try:

‍

- The Compliment Circle: Have students sit in a circle and take turns saying something nice about the person next to them. This activity helps students see their own strengths and those of their classmates.

- Public Speaking Practice: Let students present on a topic they know a lot about or really like. Giving them a safe place to practice public speaking can help them feel more confident when talking to others.

- Goal Setting and Reflection: Have students write down a goal they want to reach soon, and then make a plan to reach it. After some time, have students talk about their progress, what worked, what didn't, and what they learned.

- Team-Building Exercises: Plan activities where students can work together, solve problems, and support each other. These exercises can help students trust each other, communicate better, and feel more confident in their ability to work as a team

- Positive Affirmations: Have students make a list of positive affirmations about themselves and their abilities. Encourage them to read these affirmations out loud or quietly to themselves, especially when they're feeling unsure or down. This activity can help students believe in themselves and feel more confident.‍


#### Key Takeaways
