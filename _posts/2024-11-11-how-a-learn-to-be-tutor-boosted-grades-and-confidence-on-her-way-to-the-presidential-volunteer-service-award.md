## How many hours have you tutored?

177

‍


## Tell us about your favorite moment(s) tutoring with your student(s).

I absolutely love bonding with my students, especially when they feel a sense of accomplishment. For our lesson, my student went over sight word flashcards with me. She was particularly stuck on a word, but after multiple tries, she finally got it right. Her mom was so ecstatic she said "you did it!" and gave her praise. Even though I was separated by them through a screen I could feel her pure joy and pride. I am so grateful I get to experience these little moments with my students, it makes my time with them ever so special :)

‍


## What kind of specific impact has your tutoring had on your student?

The parents have seen significant improvements in her self-confidence and resilience. Although I haven't asked about her grades, my student tells me she volunteers to read aloud to the class and reads at a faster pace. I am so proud of her for that!

‍


## Why did you decide to earn the Presidential Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) through Learn To Be over other organizations?

LTB was the first volunteer organization I ever joined, and it was also the first to introduce me to the PVSA. I especially loved how convenient it was to help tutor with families without physical contact. I decided that even with my busy schedule, it'd be quite manageable for me to devote at least 2-4 hours a week to tutoring in order to earn volunteer hours and at least the silver PVSA. I was so excited when I had gathered enough hours for the Gold! Thank you LTB for this opportunity!

‍


## How does earning the PVSA help you in your future?

Initially, it was for making my college application stand out, but to be honest it means much more than that to me. I feel accomplished and motivated as someone who is contributing to communities globally. I hope to continue this journey with LTB for as long as I am able :)

## Anything else you'd like to add?

I just want to thank all of you who work at Learn to Be for making this possible. The staff members, junior board, Neeraj, and all of the amazing tutors! You guys are the best and I applaud you all for your hard work :) keep it up!
