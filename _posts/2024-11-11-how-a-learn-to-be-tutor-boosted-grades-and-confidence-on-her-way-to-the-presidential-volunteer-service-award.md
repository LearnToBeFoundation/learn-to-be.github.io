 I absolutely love bonding with my students, especially when they feel a sense of accomplishment. For our lesson, my student went over sight word flashcards with me. She was particularly stuck on a word, but after multiple tries, she finally got it right. Her mom was so ecstatic she said "you did it!" and gave her praise. Even though I was separated by them through a screen I could feel her pure joy and pride. I am so grateful I get to experience these little moments with my students, it makes my time with them ever so special :)

 What kind of specific impact has your tutoring had on your student?
</h2>
<p id="">
 The parents have seen significant improvements in her self-confidence and resilience. Although I haven't asked about her grades, my student tells me she volunteers to read aloud to the class and reads at a faster pace. I am so proud of her for that!

 Why did you decide to earn the Presidential Volunteer Service Award (PVSA) through Learn To Be over other organizations?
</h2>
<p id="">
 LTB was the first volunteer organization I ever joined, and it was also the first to introduce me to the PVSA. I especially loved how convenient it was to help tutor with families without physical contact. I decided that even with my busy schedule, it'd be quite manageable for me to devote at least 2-4 hours a week to tutoring in order to earn volunteer hours and at least the silver PVSA. I was so excited when I had gathered enough hours for the Gold! Thank you LTB for this opportunity!

 How does earning the PVSA help you in your future?
</h2>
<p id="">
 Initially, it was for making my college application stand out, but to be honest it means much more than that to me. I feel accomplished and motivated as someone who is contributing to communities globally. I hope to continue this journey with LTB for as long as I am able :)
